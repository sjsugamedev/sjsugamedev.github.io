      <h4>
        The Game Development Club was founded to serve as an environment for
        people to learn about the process of developing games, to play and
        understand game design, and to collaborate with others in researching
        and creating their own games.
      </h4>

      <h2>What We Provide</h2>
      <p>
        By providing tools, resources, and many forms of inspiration and
        motivation we help people learn about the game development process
        regardless of their level of experience. We also participate in game
        jams and reach out to industry professionals who can elaborate on their
        experiences and teach fundamental game making ideas to our club.
      </p>

      <h2>Where We Meet</h2>
      <p>
        We meet every Thursday at 7:00 PM at the MLK Library's Innovation
        Center, located on the Lower Level (the basement level) on our Discord
        Server. Everyone is welcome, even non-students!
      </p>

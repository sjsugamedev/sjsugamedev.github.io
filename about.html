            The Game Development Club was founded to serve as an environment for
            people to learn about the process of developing games, to play and
            understand game design, and to collaborate with others in
            researching and creating their own games.

            By providing tools, resources, and many forms of inspiration and
            motivation we help people learn about the game development process
            regardless of their level of experience. We also participate in game
            jams and reach out to industry professionals who can elaborate on
            their experiences and teach fundamental game making ideas to our
            club.

    <p>Whether you are new to game dev or want to work 
    on something big with other people, we encourage everyone 
    to join a team this semester! During this Thursday's meeting 
    at 7:00 PM on the Lower Level MLK Library and on Discord, you 
    will hear game pitches from other members of the club. After 
    going through everyone's ideas, you will form teams based on 
    what ideas you like the most. Make sure you attend!</p>
